  This project ‘Bin Buddy’ is primarily based on food waste minimization and its management. We provide a web solution to college messes to keep tracking their clients need and abstain themselves from making excess food and we also introduce a QR based attendance  or a daily register system to keep records of their consumers. For the food waste management, we will work on setting up a connection between diverse types of NGOs and the food service providers to manage the food waste by redistribution and recycling.
